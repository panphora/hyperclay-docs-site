video explaining why i care about the web
- the slow web
	- intentional
	- mixing
	- ecosystem building
- it's about creating a shared dream, a shared reality that we all contribute to
	- this is a habitat
	- not somewhere trying to hurt you or outcompete you, but one that accepts you and furthers you
	- a way for dreams to mix and merge (this is what i love about the web)
	- feel more alive online, real-time editing and feedback
