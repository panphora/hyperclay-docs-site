# The Web Was Meant To Be Malleable

---

# "The Web was designed as an interactive space where everyone can edit."
â€” Tim Berners-Lee

---

# The Original Vision
- Everyone is both creator and consumer
- Edit and share freely
- Build on each other's work

---

# What Happened?
- We built walls
- We created platforms
- We separated viewers from creators

---

# The Great Divide
Web users split into two worlds:
- Those who can deploy code
- Those who can only consume

---

# A Hard Truth
Making things for the web is now too complex:
- Multiple languages
- Complex toolchains
- Deployment pipelines

---

# But People Want to Create
They're finding ways:
- No-code tools
- Website builders
- Template marketplaces

---

# The Missing Piece
What if web pages were:
- Easy to modify
- Self-contained
- Naturally shareable

---

# Introducing Hyperspace
HTML documents that:
- Remember changes
- Update themselves
- Work anywhere

---

# Show, Don't Tell
```html
<div contenteditable="true" persist>
  Edit me and I'll remember
</div>
```
That's it. Really.

---

# How It Works
- Everything is just HTML
- Changes save automatically
- No backend required

---

# Real World Uses
People are building:
- Personal dashboards
- Team tools
- Creative experiments

---

# Growing Together
- Fork any page
- Build on others' work
- Share improvements

---

# The Web of Tomorrow
- Everyone can create
- Every page can be personal
- Every user empowered

---

# Start Simple
1. Write some HTML
2. Make it interactive
3. Share it with friends

---

# Join the Renaissance
The malleable web begins with you.
