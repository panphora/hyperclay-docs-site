	* Can run HTML apps locally, easily
	* Can publish HTML apps from local to remote
## v. Silo-ability
* I can send my app to a friend, colleague, or client and they can login and use it (i.e. just like sharing a Google Docs Edit URL)
	* Every HTML file comes with its own user account, ability to login (custom login/signup pages, maybe custom landing page)
	* SEO site widget
## v. Teams
* I can collaborate on an app with a friend or colleague
	* Real-time editing / syncing
## v. Upgrading Apps / Versioning System
* I can improve my app for other people over time
	* Each app can be versioned and updated to latest version by extracting page data and running front-end JS migrations defined in the latest page
* Import/export widget
## v. Every App a Mini SaaS / Nested multi tenacity
* I can sell my app for a low monthly charge
	* Payouts for high value contributors
	* White labeling
	* Multi-page apps / shared state

## v. HTML is a Full-Stack Programming Language
* One language to define behavior, state, visibility, page structure
* Write apps in one language without thinking
