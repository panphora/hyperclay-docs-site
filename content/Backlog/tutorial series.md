the basics
2. what is it: an interactive, distributable custom document you can program and persist with only front-end code (what if you could make a google doc/google sheet look however you want?)
	1. persistent html = small, self-contained apps
	2. the html is the db, the flattest stack, a document/spreadsheet with a nice ui
	3. small front-end ui experiments = full stack apps
3. who you are & why you want this
	1. ai artifacts
	2. live updating personal website
	3. simple apps
