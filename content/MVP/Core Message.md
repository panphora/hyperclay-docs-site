Hyperclay is a single-file CMS with an editing UI built in. It's a super simple way of getting an online project online, distributing it, and allowing frequent updates to each instance.

It's not complex like a web app.
It's not inflexible like a document.
It's not static like a website.

It's an HTML app â€” fully styleable by you. Fully cloneable, shareable, and editable by you or your clients.
