## Core message

Achieve the zen of shipping a single-file HTML app.

## Brand story paragraph

You love crafting web experiences, but hate the bloat of frameworks and build processes. You wish you could focus on the core experience you want to build and not get sucked into rabbit holes of configuration and boilerplate. Hyperclay gives you a directly-manipulable digital object in the form of a single HTML file. Now you don't have to juggle a 1,000 file project; you can focus on building the core experience that matters most to your users.

* Keeps a `/experiments` folder full of HTML prototypes
* Maintains a personal site with handmade HTML
* Writes about the joy of creating vs. the pain of configuring
* Bookmarks tools with "no-build", "zero-config", "instant" in the name
* Shares articles about the "old web", "vanilla JS", and "view-source culture"

#### Narrative Snapshot

> "I had an idea for an interactive story. Instead of losing an hour to boilerplate and build setup, I opened Hyperclay and started coding the interface. My entire focus could stay on the UX. That's how web creation should feel."

> "Last weekend I built three small web toys. Not three repo setups—three actual experiences users can play with. Each one is a single HTML file I can tweak, share, and evolve. I got to stay focused on what matters: the UI and experience."
