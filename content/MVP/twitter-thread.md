# Twitter Thread: The Backend Complexity Tax

## Thread

**1/**
Every developer knows this feeling:

"I could build this frontend in 2 hours."

*3 months later*

"I'm still configuring the authentication system."

We've normalized an insane amount of complexity for what should be simple persistence.

**2/**
Here's the dirty secret of modern web development:

90% of apps don't need:
- User accounts
- API routes  
- Database schemas
- State management libraries
- Deployment pipelines

They just need their changes to... stick around.

**3/**
Think about it. 

localStorage was SO CLOSE to solving this.

But it only saves on YOUR machine. Not shareable. Not portable.

So instead we built entire industries around solving what should be a trivial problem.

**4/**
The modern web stack for a TODO app:

- React/Vue/Angular
- Node.js backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for sessions
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline
- AWS/Vercel hosting

For a LIST. That persists. ðŸ¤¯

**5/**
Remember when you first learned to code?

You'd edit an HTML file, hit refresh, and SEE THE CHANGE.

Now?

Edit â†’ Save â†’ Compile â†’ Bundle â†’ Deploy â†’ Wait for CI â†’ Check staging â†’ Merge â†’ Deploy to prod â†’ Clear cache â†’ Finally see change

We've lost something fundamental.

**6/**
"But that's how professional software is built!"

Is it though?

Or did we collectively agree to an enormous complexity tax because we couldn't figure out how to make simple things... simple?

**7/**
Here's what kills me:

Tim Berners-Lee designed the web to be read/write.

"The Web was designed as an interactive space where everyone can edit"

Instead we built a read-only web that requires a computer science degree to publish to.

**8/**
The saddest part?

New developers think this complexity is NECESSARY.

They learn React before HTML.
They learn Express before understanding HTTP.
They configure Webpack without knowing what they're bundling.

We're teaching the tooling, not the craft.

**9/**
What if I told you there's another way?

What if your HTML file could:
- Display information
- Modify itself
- Save changes
- Be shared instantly
- Work offline
- Be owned completely by you

No backend. No database. No deployment.

**10/**
This isn't a pipe dream.

I've been building something that makes this possible.

One HTML file = Your entire app.

Edit it live. Changes persist. Share the URL. Others can clone and modify.

It's called @hyperclay.

The web that should have been.
