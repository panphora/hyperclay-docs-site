# Twitter Thread: When You Have 99 Side Projects

## Thread

**1/**
I have 47 unfinished side projects.

Each one started with excitement.
Each one died in a webpack config.

The worst part? I can't even remember what half of them were supposed to do.

**2/**
Here's what kills momentum:

Friday night: "I'll build this cool interactive story!"

Saturday morning: 
- npm init
- Install 73 dependencies
- Configure build tools
- Set up hot reloading
- Debug TypeScript errors

Saturday afternoon: "What was I building again?"

**3/**
The modern web has a cognitive overhead problem.

Your "simple" todo app:
- 1,247 files in node_modules
- 18 config files
- 5 different languages
- 3 build steps

Your actual idea: 200 lines of code.

**4/**
I started keeping a graveyard folder:

/abandoned-projects
  /smart-bookmark-manager (2021)
  /habit-tracker-v3 (2022)
  /interactive-fiction-engine (2022)
  /markdown-canvas (2023)
  /time-zone-planner (2023)

Each one: thousands of files I'll never understand again.

**5/**
The real tragedy?

These weren't bad ideas. They were murdered by complexity.

Every unfinished project adds to your mental load. Background processes in your brain, never quite closing.

**6/**
What if your entire app was ONE file?

Not "one file that imports 50 others."
Not "one file that builds to many."

One. Actual. File.

UI, logic, data, styling. All visible. All editable. All *graspable*.

**7/**
Imagine opening a project from 3 years ago and understanding it in 30 seconds.

No:
- "What version of React was this?"
- "Why won't npm install work?"
- "What did this webpack plugin do?"

Just your idea, preserved in amber.

**8/**
The old web had this right.

You could view source. 
You could understand.
You could tinker.

We traded that for "scalability" we never needed.

**9/**
Here's my new rule:

If I can't hold the entire project in my head, I'm using the wrong tool.

Mental space is for crafting experiences, not debugging build systems.

**10/**
This is why I'm obsessed with @hyperclay.

One HTML file = Your entire app.
Edit it live. It saves itself.
Come back in 5 years, still works.

Finally, tools that respect your cognitive limits.

Your ideas deserve better than node_modules.
