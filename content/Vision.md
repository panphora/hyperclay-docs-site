description: The vision for Hyperclay - creating digital experiences that feel as natural and immediate as shaping physical clay
---

The joy of a craftsperson shaping clay without thinking.

Make an app in the moment for someone on the train and hand it to them like a physical object.

Shape the world and our perception of it in real-time using digital objects that behave like physical materials.

## Hyperclay v1
**what:** The personal software stack
**how:** Every HTML file becomes a living, self-contained app
**why:** To build meaningful things for people without the mental overhead, like writing a Google Doc instead of coordinating a constellation of separate systems

## Hyperclay Future
**what:** The natural way to shape interactive experiences
**how:** HTML itself as the complete language for state, behavior, and interaction—no separation needed
**why:** To create software that feels real, where changes persist naturally like clay holds its shape, where you can hold the entire application in your mind at once and understand it intuitively

## Platform

I want Hyperclay to be a place where you can not only create self-contained applications, but also a place that returns value to creators.

So, while I want all of these features:

- Query pages with CSS to return JSON, turning each document into its own database
- Group pages into multi-document applications that share data
- Publish directly from your local machine, using your preferred editor
- Run pages locally as personal desktop applications, maintaining privacy and increasing performance
- Enable real-time collaboration through selective synchronization

I will lean into the following features, so people can extract as much value from their creativity as possible:

- Host pages on custom domains
- Charge for access to certain pages, keeping 90% of revenue
- Password protect sensitive documents

When people are able to use Hyperclay as both a hosting platform and a new way of thinking about software, then I can focus on more experimental features that push the boundaries of what's possible.

But first, I need to ensure Hyperclay returns more value to its creators than it extracts.

### Long Term Goal

Our long-term goal is to empower individuals and small teams to build personal software that fits how they think—deconstructing the complexity of large-scale systems into smaller, more malleable tools.

We believe this return to simplicity will make the web more personal, vibrant, and free—closer to its original vision where everyone could both read and write.
