most sites perform a single function

you give it some data, your site and some keywords, for example

and it calls a function() on that data

and returns the results

there's a certain subset of those functional websites that i always believed were far too complex

it's the kind of website where the data you enter is processed minimally and then presented to you on the page in a different form

think spreadsheet, website builder, graph, planner, visualizer, or game

anything where the site doesn't need to do some real-time complex data processing behind the scenes to give you what you want

those kinds of functions should be easy to build

trivial, even

that's what hyperspace is

it's a way of creating a function that processes some user data and outputs a site or visualization or interactive experience

but, so what, you say, that's what every website builder under the sun does, right?

yes and no

what hyperspace does different is it has no separation between what you see and what you get

it's a wysiwyg editor built into the browser, using the browser's own devtools

that, however, is only moderately cool

the cool part comes from your ability to create and customize your own editing experience of hyperspace

don't like wordpress's new page editor? build one on top of hyperspace and use it on your own site

don't like the way graphs are presented in your daily standup? build your own graph generator on top of hyperspace

but wait, that's not the coolest part

the coolest part is you know that single function i was talking about earlier?

well, these days, developers have to go to sites like NPM and GitHub in order to download code and then install it on their sites

this code that's shared freely with them takes time to find and configure and it's hidden in repositories

but at the end of the day, it acts like a function upon the function of the site

it's a second level function that modifies how the site is able to modify itself

what if that was done in the open? well, it is on hyperspace

on hyperspace, you can make functions that modify functions that modify functions that modify a site

what does that mean in practice?

it means you can give ordinary people the power to edit the tools that edit how their site can be edited

and allow other people to ship customer website editors, or custom functions in the open, without code

that's kind of cool

it's like it github and codepen had a baby

and everything was open source on codepen

and the demo came before the readme

and everything was live and interactive and changing and evolving in real time

that's the web i dream of

the web of connection and constant evolution

the web that allows klint to exist

a changeable form of matter that fits where you put it and becomes what you need it to be

a puzzle piece that locks into your mind and transforms how you work

a web that fits you instead of a solid, unchangeable locked in platform that locks creativity down

an open, more collaborative web

a web of dreams coming to life in real time
