description: Core principles guiding Hyperclay development - prioritizing natural web interactions, native technology, and user experience
---

- Make the web feel natural: Existing on the web and manipulating it should feel as easy and intuitive as interacting with the physical world
- Use Native Technology: Leverage standard web technologies so we don't end up reinventing the web.
- Default to Open Source: Foster the rapid evolution of ideas by coding as much as possible in the open.
- User Experience Over Profits: People come first because we're building a product. Making it intuitively tangible is our focus.
- Do Web Dev The "Wrong" Way When It Works Better: All rules should be rewritten regularly to serve the people they're meant to serve.
- Flatten the Stack: We want people to create simple, malleable digital objects that can fit easily in people's heads.
