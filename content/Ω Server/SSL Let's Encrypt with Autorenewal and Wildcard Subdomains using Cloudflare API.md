# SSL Auto-Renewal Setup Guide

## Quick Setup for New Domains

### 1. Install Certbot and Get Certificate
```bash
# Install certbot with Cloudflare plugin
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare

# Get certificate (replace with your domain)
sudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini -d yourdomain.com -d *.yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Add Auto-Reload Hook
```bash
# Add post-hook to certificate config
echo "post_hook = /bin/systemctl reload nginx" | sudo tee -a /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/yourdomain.com.conf
```

### 3. Verify Auto-Renewal Setup
```bash
# Check timer is enabled
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer

# Test renewal (dry run)
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Force renewal to test hook
sudo certbot renew --force-renewal --cert-name yourdomain.com

# Should see: "Running post-hook command: /bin/systemctl reload nginx"
```

## Troubleshooting Expired Certificates

### Check Certificate Status
```bash
# Check current certificate expiration
echo | openssl s_client -servername yourdomain.com -connect yourdomain.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

# Check certbot certificates
sudo certbot certificates
```

### Fix Expired Certificates
```bash
# If certificates exist but web server serves old ones
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# If certificates are actually expired
sudo certbot renew --force-renewal

# Check nginx picked up new certificates
echo | openssl s_client -servername yourdomain.com -connect yourdomain.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```

### Verify Hook is Working
```bash
# Check for post-hook in config
grep "post_hook" /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/yourdomain.com.conf

# Check nginx reload logs
sudo journalctl -u nginx --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i reload
```

## Key Points

- **Auto-renewal runs twice daily** via `certbot.timer`
- **Post-hook reloads nginx** automatically after renewal
- **Test with force renewal** to verify everything works
- **Certificates renew ~30 days before expiry**
- **No manual intervention needed** once properly configured

## File Locations

- Certificate configs: `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/`
- Live certificates: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/`
- Cloudflare credentials: `/etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini`

## ORIGINAL CONVERSATION COPIED BELOW ⬇️

help me set up ssl for all subdomains and root domain on my digital ocean server using nginx. i have a node.js app if that matters. i want to use the cloudflare api to setup auto renewal of these ssl certs. here's my current setup.

server {
    server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9999;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
}

Edit
I'll help you set up SSL with auto-renewal using Cloudflare. Here's what we'll do:

First, install certbot and the Cloudflare plugin:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare
Create a Cloudflare API token:
Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Profile > API Tokens
Create a token with the following permissions:
Zone:DNS
Zone:Zone
Create Cloudflare credentials file (keep this secure):
bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflare
sudo nano /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini
Add this content:

ini
dns_cloudflare_api_token = your_api_token_here
Set proper permissions:

bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini
Get SSL certificate for your domain and all subdomains:
bash
sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini \
  -d hyperclay.com \
  -d *.hyperclay.com
Update your Nginx configuration:
nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;
  
  # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;

  # SSL configuration
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/privkey.pem;
  ssl_session_timeout 1d;
  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
  ssl_session_tickets off;

  # Modern configuration
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

  # HSTS (uncomment if you're sure)
  # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9999;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
Set up auto-renewal by creating a renewal hook:
bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy
sudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/nginx-reload.sh
Add this content:

bash
#!/bin/bash
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
Make it executable:

bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/nginx-reload.sh
Test the renewal process:
bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
Certbot automatically creates a renewal cron job at /etc/cron.d/certbot. You can verify it with:
bash
cat /etc/cron.d/certbot
After completing these steps:

Test your Nginx configuration: sudo nginx -t
If successful, reload Nginx: sudo systemctl reload nginx
Your site should now be accessible via HTTPS, with certificates auto-renewing before expiration. The configuration includes modern SSL settings and handles both www and non-www domains. The certificate will also work for any subdomains you create later.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?




i got this after this command

sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini \
  -d hyperclay.com \
  -d *.hyperclay.com
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for hyperclay.com and *.hyperclay.com
Waiting 10 seconds for DNS changes to propagate

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-04-07.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

Edit
Great! The certificate was successfully generated. Now let's proceed with updating your Nginx configuration to use these certificates.

First, backup your current Nginx configuration:
bash
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.backup
Update your Nginx configuration with the SSL settings:
nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;
  
  # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;

  # SSL configuration
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/privkey.pem;
  ssl_session_timeout 1d;
  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
  ssl_session_tickets off;

  # Modern configuration
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9999;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    
    # Add X-Forwarded-Proto header for SSL
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
Test the configuration:
bash
sudo nginx -t
If the test is successful, reload Nginx:
bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
Your site should now be accessible via HTTPS. Try visiting https://hyperclay.com to verify it works.

The certificate will auto-renew since Certbot has already set up the cron job. You can verify the renewal schedule with:

bash
systemctl list-timers certbot
Would you like me to explain anything about the configuration or help troubleshoot if you encounter any issues?




what the heck is ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;

Edit
The ssl_ciphers line defines the list of encryption algorithms that your server will accept for HTTPS connections, in order of preference. Let me break it down:

Each cipher suite (the parts separated by colons) describes a combination of cryptographic algorithms used for different aspects of the SSL/TLS connection:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 breaks down as:
- ECDHE: Key Exchange algorithm (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)
- ECDSA: Authentication algorithm (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- AES128: Bulk encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit key)
- GCM: Mode of operation for the cipher
- SHA256: Hashing algorithm for message authentication
This particular list is Mozilla's "modern" configuration, which:

Only includes very secure, modern ciphers
Prioritizes ECDHE (Elliptic Curve) over DHE for better performance
Includes both ECDSA and RSA options for compatibility
Uses either AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption
Excludes older, less secure ciphers
You could simplify it to something like:

nginx
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
But using the detailed list is considered best practice as it gives you explicit control over which ciphers are accepted and in what order. The long version ensures maximum security while maintaining compatibility with modern browsers.




what does this mean

2025/01/07 21:41:00 [warn] 214669
#214669: protocol options redefined for [::]:443 in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so:13

Edit
That warning means you have multiple server blocks in your Nginx configuration that are defining SSL/TLS protocol options for the same port (443) and IPv6 address ([::]).

This typically happens when you have SSL settings like ssl_protocols or ssl_ciphers defined in multiple places, such as:

In multiple server blocks in the same config file
In both the main nginx.conf and your site config
In multiple enabled site configurations
To fix this:

Check all your config files for duplicate SSL settings:
bash
grep -r "ssl_protocols" /etc/nginx/
grep -r "ssl_ciphers" /etc/nginx/
Make sure SSL settings appear only once for each server block or move them to the http block in nginx.conf if you want them to apply globally.
In your case, check:

/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so line 13
Any other config files in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
The main /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
While this warning won't break your setup, it's good practice to clean it up to avoid confusion and ensure your SSL settings are applied as intended.




cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so
server {
    server_name hyperspace.so www.hyperspace.so;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8989;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperspace.so/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperspace.so/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = www.hyperspace.so) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = hyperspace.so) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name hyperspace.so www.hyperspace.so;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot

}

Edit
Ah, I see! The warning is happening because you have two different sources of SSL configuration:

In your other config file, we added explicit SSL settings (ssl_protocols, ssl_ciphers, etc.)
In this file, you're including Certbot's default SSL options with:
nginx
include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
To fix this, you should choose one approach. Since you already have Certbot managing this domain, let's stick with Certbot's approach for consistency.

Update your config for hyperclay.com to match this style:

nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hyperclay.com/privkey.pem;
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9999;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name hyperclay.com www.hyperclay.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
This will:

Remove the duplicate SSL protocol options
Keep consistent with Certbot's management approach
Still maintain all the security benefits
After making this change, test and reload Nginx:

bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
The warning should be gone now.




still getting 2025/01/07 21:44:33 [warn] 214771
#214771: protocol options redefined for [::]:443 in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so:13

Edit
Let's track down all SSL configurations across your Nginx setup. First, let's see what's in the Certbot options file and check for any other config files:

bash
# Check what's in the Certbot SSL options file
cat /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf

# List all enabled sites
ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Check main nginx conf for SSL settings
grep -r "ssl" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Could you run these commands and share the output? This will help us identify where the duplicate SSL settings are coming from.

Also, since we're getting the warning specifically about hyperspace.so:13, it suggests there might be another config file or global setting that's conflicting with this site's SSL configuration. Let's also check if there are any SSL settings in the http block of your main nginx.conf that might be causing this.

Would you mind running these commands and sharing the output? That way we can pinpoint exactly where the duplicate settings are coming from.




cat /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf
# This file contains important security parameters. If you modify this file
# manually, Certbot will be unable to automatically provide future security
# updates. Instead, Certbot will print and log an error message with a path to

# this file. Contents are based on https://ssl-config.mozilla.org

Edit
Ah, there's the issue! You have SSL settings in multiple places:

In /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:
nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
In /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf (included by your site configs):
nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
These conflict with each other. Let's fix this:

Remove the SSL settings from nginx.conf. Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and comment out or remove these lines:
nginx
# Comment out or remove these lines
# ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
# ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
Let Certbot handle the SSL configuration through its options-ssl-nginx.conf file, which has more secure defaults (it disables TLSv1 and TLSv1.1).
After making these changes:

bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
The warning should now be gone, and you'll be using the more secure SSL configuration from Certbot.




2025/01/07 21:46:30 [warn] 214826
#214826: protocol options redefined for [::]:443 in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so:13

Edit
Let's check the actual content of ALL your site configurations to find any other SSL settings:

bash
# Check default site
cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Check hyperclay config
cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperclay.com
Could you run these commands and share their output? The warning suggests there might be overlapping SSL configurations in one of these files.

Also, let me confirm - did you comment out those SSL settings in nginx.conf that we found earlier?

Since the warning specifically mentions line 13 in hyperspace.so config (which we've already seen), the conflict must be coming from either the default site configuration or the hyperclay.com configuration that are also enabled.

Edit
That default config doesn't have any active SSL settings (they're all commented out). Let's check:

bash
cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperclay.com
Also, I notice none of the configs we've seen so far account for line 13 of hyperspace.so having a protocol redefinition. Let's confirm the line numbers:

bash
nl /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so
Given that the warning is specifically about line 13 in hyperspace.so, and we've seen all the configs, there might be an inclusion order issue. Could you also run:

bash
ls -la /etc/nginx/conf.d/
This will help us check if there are any additional config files being loaded that might contain SSL settings.

Edit
So the warning message is pointing to line 13 in hyperspace.so, but looking at the actual content, line 13 is just the SSL certificate path. This suggests that the numbering in the error message might not be what we should focus on.

The real issue seems to be that both sites (hyperclay.com and hyperspace.so) are:

Including the same options file (/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf)
Both listening on port 443
Both using IPv6 ([::]:443)
Let's try a different approach. Instead of including the options in each server block, we can move the common SSL settings to the http context in nginx.conf.

First, modify /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. Find the http block and add:
nginx
http {
    # ... (existing settings)

    # Global SSL configuration
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;

    # ... (rest of settings)
}
Then remove the include line from both site configs. In hyperspace.so, remove:
nginx
include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
And in hyperclay.com, remove:
nginx
include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
After making these changes:

bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
This should resolve the warning while maintaining all the security settings. The SSL options will be defined once globally instead of being redefined in each server block.




still this:
2025/01/07 21:51:01 [warn] 214940
#214940: protocol options redefined for [::]:443 in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperspace.so:13

can i just ignore it?

Edit
Yes, you can safely ignore this warning. It's just Nginx being very particular about where SSL settings are defined. The warning doesn't indicate any security issues or functional problems - your SSL configuration is still secure and working correctly.

The warning appears because the SSL settings are being defined multiple times (once globally and once per site), but Nginx is still using the correct settings. If the warning really bothers you we can fix it, but if everything is working fine (sites loading over HTTPS, no browser warnings, etc.), it's perfectly safe to ignore this particular warning.




okay, back to the instructions, what do i do now?

Edit
Looking back at where we were in the SSL setup process:

✅ You've already got the Cloudflare API token configured
✅ You've successfully generated SSL certificates using certbot
✅ You've configured Nginx to use the certificates
✅ Auto-renewal is set up (Certbot did this automatically)
Let's verify everything is working:

Test your sites are accessible via HTTPS:
bash
curl -I https://hyperclay.com
curl -I https://hyperspace.so
Verify the auto-renewal is properly configured:
bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
Check when your certificates will renew:
bash
systemctl list-timers certbot
If all these checks pass, you're all set! Your sites are secured with SSL and will auto-renew via Cloudflare DNS.

Would you like me to explain anything about the renewal process or help test anything specific?




i need to restart nginx

Edit
To restart Nginx, you have two options:

bash
# Full restart (stops then starts)
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Or more gracefully reload the config
sudo systemctl reload nginx
The reload is generally preferred as it won't drop any active connections. But if you specifically need a full restart, use the first command.

Edit
The error shows that hyperspace.so's certificate isn't renewing because Certbot can't use port 80 - it's being blocked by Nginx. This is happening because hyperspace.so was set up with a different authentication method than hyperclay.com.

hyperclay.com is using DNS authentication (which works fine), but hyperspace.so is trying to use HTTP authentication (which requires port 80 access).

Let's fix this by switching hyperspace.so to use DNS authentication like hyperclay.com:

bash
# First, remove the existing certificate for hyperspace.so
sudo certbot delete --cert-name hyperspace.so

# Then get a new certificate using DNS authentication
sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini \
  -d hyperspace.so \
  -d www.hyperspace.so
After this completes, run the dry-run test again:

bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
Both certificates should now successfully simulate renewal since they're both using DNS authentication through Cloudflare.

Unable to determine zone_id for hyperspace.so using zone names: ['hyperspace.so', 'so']. Please confirm that the domain name has been entered correctly and is already associated with the supplied Cloudflare account.

Edit
This error means Cloudflare can't find the domain hyperspace.so in your account. We have two options:

If hyperspace.so is supposed to be managed by Cloudflare:
Log into your Cloudflare account
Add hyperspace.so as a new domain/site
Wait for DNS propagation (usually a few minutes)
Then try the certbot command again
If hyperspace.so is NOT managed by Cloudflare, we can use a different authentication method:
bash
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d hyperspace.so -d www.hyperspace.so
Which option would you prefer? Is hyperspace.so supposed to be managed through Cloudflare?

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: dns-cloudflare). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: www.hyperspace.so
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: No TXT record found at _acme-challenge.www.hyperspace.so

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the DNS TXT records created by --dns-cloudflare. Ensure the above domains are hosted by this DNS provider, or try increasing --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds (currently 10 seconds).

Edit
This error means we need to give more time for DNS changes to propagate. Let's try the command again with a longer wait time:

bash
sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare/cloudflare.ini \
  --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 60 \
  -d hyperspace.so \
  -d www.hyperspace.so
If that still doesn't work, we can fall back to using the simpler Nginx authentication method since you already have Nginx running:

bash
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d hyperspace.so -d www.hyperspace.so
Let's try the first command with the longer propagation time first, and if that fails, we'll use the Nginx method.

Edit
Great! The certificate was successfully generated. Now let's test the renewal again:

bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
This should now work for both certificates since they're both using the same DNS authentication method. After we confirm the dry-run works, we should reload Nginx to ensure it's using the new certificates:

bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx



certbot renew --dry-run

Edit
Perfect! Both certificates are now set up correctly and will auto-renew. Let's verify everything is working:

Reload Nginx to ensure it's using the new certificates:
bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
Test the HTTPS connections:
bash
curl -I https://hyperclay.com
curl -I https://hyperspace.so
Everything should be set now:

Both domains have SSL certificates
Both are configured to auto-renew using Cloudflare DNS authentication
Nginx is configured to serve both sites over HTTPS
The renewal dry-run test passed for both certificates
Do you want to verify anything else or do you have any questions about the setup?
