hyperspace
shape the web

web hosting for AI artifacts

a place to host persistent, malleable software generated with the help of AI

you've become 10x more productive coding up quick, one-off interactive web experiences, but you have nowhere to show them off

host them on hyperspace let them go viral

storybrand: dev using ai daily has nowhere to put useful artifacts which is like finding a gem and having no one to show it to, frustrated because it's truly useful, would like to see others benefit, especially family and friends, runs into hyperspace, sees someone who's been building web platforms for a while and loves building small useful tools and uses ai daily, make a plan for putting yourself out there (a guide: be 100% honest, push through doubt and surprise yourself, resist cleaning it up and just go with it), 1. paste your artifact, 2. publish it, 3. watch as people use it, watch people use your useful software instead of it going to waste in private, go from going long stretches without sharing anything to building in public and sharing all the time
