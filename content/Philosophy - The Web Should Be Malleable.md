description: A manifesto for making the web malleable, habitable, and intuitive - where digital creation feels as natural as shaping clay
---

The web should be malleable, a place where digital objects let you shape the light from your screen in real time. It should feel like you're a part of the web, breathing it, grounded in it, part of a living ecosystem. 

## The web should be habitable.

The web isn’t an enemy or a trap. You’re not prey — you’re powerful here. You enjoy being here, creating your reality alongside like-minded individuals.

Imagine playing with blocks and a toy car. You build a ramp out of the blocks and drive the car over it. It does a double flip in the air. That's the type of simple, immersive fun the web should be able to capture. But in the realm of the present-day web, it’s different — far too much work goes into just making an immersive system and, after it's built, it's far too rigid and brittle. 

## The web should be moldable and expansive.

The web frustrates me. It's too static. The ecosystem is not diverse enough. There aren't enough doodads. I think that's because there's too much distance (in both effort and time) between an idea and making it work — too much space between dreams and reality here. 

I want to be able to contribute to the internet at the speed of thought, not wrestle with web services. I want to create worlds, see people play, and see their ideas merge with each other naturally. Building interactive web objects should feel like picking up an apple or slicing an orange — immediate, visceral, intuitive, and natural.

## The web stack should be flat.

Right now individual developers are struggling because building dynamic digital objects is hard. But so many of them know HTML, CSS, JS. What if they could build shapeable digital objects with just front-end tech? This would remove the backend, getting us a step closer to a single-layer stack.

Digital objects (websites, web apps, MMORPGs) grow and evolve over time. People grow alongside them and help shape them. They’re real, malleable, and exist in the present. The best internet companies know this: they spend the time building the primitives that allow them to iterate on their worlds closer to the speed of thought.

## A new primitive: shapeable hypermedia.

Everyone should have access to a system that supports execution at the speed of thought. A blank interactive canvas: infinitely malleable, cloneable, shareable. An open platform for your ideas. You can hold it in your mind as a single thing and it just makes sense. You can mold it with your hands. It's not a fuzzy abstraction — it's real.

What if internet-connected objects could be shaped like physical reality? No backend to worry about. No complexity. The shapeable internet becomes the thing itself, not just a representation. It’s your personal world. You have complete power.

## Our goal:

A place where you shape the light from your screen directly.
